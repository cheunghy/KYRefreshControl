KYRefreshControl
=================================

A bare bone implementation of a pull to refresh.

You can easily create your own style pull to refresh with this class, compatible with UIRefreshControl api.

This is also a demo of reimplementation of David Rönnqvist’s [blogpost-codesample-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/d-ronnqvist/blogpost-codesample-PullToRefresh
) by subclassing KYRefreshControl.
